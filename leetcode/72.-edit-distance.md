# 72. Edit Distance

## Problem

Given two strings `word1` and `word2`, return _the minimum number of operations required to convert `word1` to `word2`_.

You have the following three operations permitted on a word:

* Insert a character
* Delete a character
* Replace a character

**Example 1:**

```text
Input: word1 = "horse", word2 = "ros"
Output: 3
Explanation: 
horse -> rorse (replace 'h' with 'r')
rorse -> rose (remove 'r')
rose -> ros (remove 'e')
```

**Example 2:**

```text
Input: word1 = "intention", word2 = "execution"
Output: 5
Explanation: 
intention -> inention (remove 't')
inention -> enention (replace 'i' with 'e')
enention -> exention (replace 'n' with 'x')
exention -> exection (replace 'n' with 'c')
exection -> execution (insert 'u')
```

**Constraints:**

* `0 <= word1.length, word2.length <= 500`
* `word1` and `word2` consist of lowercase English letters.

## Solution

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int minDistance(string word1, string word2) {
        const int m = word1.size() + 1;
        const int n = word2.size() + 1;
        int dp[m][n];
        dp[0][0] = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i < m; ++i) dp[i][0] = i;
        for (int i = 1; i < n; ++i) dp[0][i] = i;
        for (int i = 1; i < m; ++i) {
            for (int j = 1; j < n; ++j) {
                if (word1[i - 1] == word2[j - 1]) {
                    dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j - 1];
                } else {
                    dp[i][j] = min(dp[i - 1][j - 1], min(dp[i - 1][j], dp[i][j - 1])) + 1;
                }
            }
        }
        return dp[m - 1][n - 1];
    }
};
```
