# 207. Course Schedule

## Problem

There are a total of `numCourses` courses you have to take, labeled from `0` to `numCourses-1`.

Some courses may have prerequisites, for example to take course 0 you have to first take course 1, which is expressed as a pair: `[0,1]`

Given the total number of courses and a list of prerequisite **pairs**, is it possible for you to finish all courses?

**Example 1:**

```text
Input: numCourses = 2, prerequisites = [[1,0]]
Output: true
Explanation: There are a total of 2 courses to take. 
             To take course 1 you should have finished course 0. So it is possible.
```

**Example 2:**

```text
Input: numCourses = 2, prerequisites = [[1,0],[0,1]]
Output: false
Explanation: There are a total of 2 courses to take. 
             To take course 1 you should have finished course 0, and to take course 0 you should
             also have finished course 1. So it is impossible.
```

**Constraints:**

* The input prerequisites is a graph represented by **a list of edges**, not adjacency matrices. Read more about [how a graph is represented](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-science/algorithms/graph-representation/a/representing-graphs).
* You may assume that there are no duplicate edges in the input prerequisites.
* `1 <= numCourses <= 10^5`

## Solution

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool canFinish(const int n, vector<vector<int>>& pre) {
        int indegree[n];
        memset(indegree, 0, sizeof(int) * n);
        vector<vector<int>> adj(n, vector<int>());
        for (const auto &edge: pre) {
            adj[edge[1]].emplace_back(edge[0]);
            ++indegree[edge[0]];
        }
        stack<int> nodes;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            if (indegree[i] == 0) nodes.push(i);
        }
        int finished = 0;
        while (!nodes.empty()) {
            const int current = nodes.top();
            nodes.pop();
            for (const int adj: adj[current]) {
                --indegree[adj];
                if (indegree[adj] == 0) nodes.push(adj);
            }
            ++finished;
        }
        return finished == n;
    }
    
   
};
```
