# 1049. Last Stone Weight II

## Problem

We have a collection of rocks, each rock has a positive integer weight.

Each turn, we choose **any two rocks** and smash them together.  Suppose the stones have weights `x` and `y` with `x <= y`.  The result of this smash is:

* If `x == y`, both stones are totally destroyed;
* If `x != y`, the stone of weight `x` is totally destroyed, and the stone of weight `y` has new weight `y-x`.

At the end, there is at most 1 stone left.  Return the **smallest possible** weight of this stone \(the weight is 0 if there are no stones left.\)

**Example 1:**

```text
Input: [2,7,4,1,8,1]
Output: 1
Explanation: 
We can combine 2 and 4 to get 2 so the array converts to [2,7,1,8,1] then,
we can combine 7 and 8 to get 1 so the array converts to [2,1,1,1] then,
we can combine 2 and 1 to get 1 so the array converts to [1,1,1] then,
we can combine 1 and 1 to get 0 so the array converts to [1] then that's the optimal value.
```

**Note:**

1. `1 <= stones.length <= 30`
2. `1 <= stones[i] <= 100`

## Solution

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int lastStoneWeightII(vector<int>& stones) {
        int sum = 0;
        for (const auto n: stones) sum += n;
        const int S = sum / 2 + 1;
        bool dp[S];
        memset(dp, 0, S);
        dp[0] = true;
        for (int i = 0; i < stones.size(); ++i) {
            for (int s = S - 1; s >= stones[i]; s--) {
                dp[s] = dp[s] || dp[s - stones[i]];
            }
        }
        for (int s = S - 1; s > 0; --s) {
            if (dp[s]) return sum - 2 * s;
        }
        return -1;
    }
};
