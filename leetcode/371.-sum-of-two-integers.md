# 371. Sum of Two Integers

## Problem

Calculate the sum of two integers a and b, but you are **not allowed** to use the operator `+` and `-`.

**Example 1:**

```text
Input: a = 1, b = 2
Output: 3
```

**Example 2:**

```text
Input: a = -2, b = 3
Output: 1
```

## Solution

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int getSum(unsigned int a, unsigned int b) {
        while (b != 0) {
            unsigned int temp = a;
            a = a ^ b;
            b = (temp & b) << 1;
        }
        return a;
    }
};
```
