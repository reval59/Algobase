# 63. Unique Paths II

A robot is located at the top-left corner of a _m_ x _n_ grid \(marked 'Start' in the diagram below\).

The robot can only move either down or right at any point in time. The robot is trying to reach the bottom-right corner of the grid \(marked 'Finish' in the diagram below\).

Now consider if some obstacles are added to the grids. How many unique paths would there be?

![](../.gitbook/assets/robot_maze.png)

An obstacle and empty space is marked as `1` and `0` respectively in the grid.

**Note:** _m_ and _n_ will be at most 100.

**Example 1:**

```text
Input:
[
  [0,0,0],
  [0,1,0],
  [0,0,0]
]
Output: 2
Explanation:
There is one obstacle in the middle of the 3x3 grid above.
There are two ways to reach the bottom-right corner:
1. Right -> Right -> Down -> Down
2. Down -> Down -> Right -> Right
```

## Solution

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int uniquePathsWithObstacles(vector<vector<int>>& obstacleGrid) {
        if (obstacleGrid.empty()) return 0;
        const int m = obstacleGrid.size(), n = obstacleGrid[0].size();
        int dp[m][n];
        memset(dp, 0, m * n * sizeof(int));
        for (int i = 0; i < m; ++i) {
            if (obstacleGrid[i][0]) break;
            dp[i][0] = 1;
        }
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            if (obstacleGrid[0][i]) break;
            dp[0][i] = 1;
        }
        
        for (int i = 1; i < m; ++i) {
            for (int j = 1; j < n; ++j) {
                if (obstacleGrid[i][j]) continue;
                dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j] + dp[i][j - 1];
            }
        }
        return dp[m - 1][n - 1];
    }
};
```
