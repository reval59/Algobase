# 16. 3Sum Closest

## Problem

Given an array `nums` of _n_ integers and an integer `target`, find three integers in `nums` such that the sum is closest to `target`. Return the sum of the three integers. You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution.

**Example 1:**

```text
Input: nums = [-1,2,1,-4], target = 1
Output: 2
Explanation: The sum that is closest to the target is 2. (-1 + 2 + 1 = 2).
```

**Constraints:**

* `3 <= nums.length <= 10^3`
* `-10^3 <= nums[i] <= 10^3`
* `-10^4 <= target <= 10^4`

## Solution

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int threeSumClosest(vector<int>& nums, int target) {
        sort(nums.begin(), nums.end());
        int min_diff = INT_MAX;
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.size(); ++i) {
            int begin = i + 1, end = nums.size() - 1;
            while (begin < end) {
                const int threesum = nums[i] + nums[begin] + nums[end];
                const int diff = threesum - target;
                if (abs(min_diff) > abs(diff)) min_diff = diff;
                if (diff == 0) return target;
                if (diff > 0) --end;
                else ++begin;
            }
        }
        return target + min_diff;
    }
};
```
