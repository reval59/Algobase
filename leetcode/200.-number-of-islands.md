# 200. Number of Islands

## Problem

Given an `m x n` 2d `grid` map of `'1'`s \(land\) and `'0'`s \(water\), return _the number of islands_.

An **island** is surrounded by water and is formed by connecting adjacent lands horizontally or vertically. You may assume all four edges of the grid are all surrounded by water.

**Example 1:**

```text
Input: grid = [
  ["1","1","1","1","0"],
  ["1","1","0","1","0"],
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],
  ["0","0","0","0","0"]
]
Output: 1
```

**Example 2:**

```text
Input: grid = [
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],
  ["0","0","1","0","0"],
  ["0","0","0","1","1"]
]
Output: 3
```

**Constraints:**

* `m == grid.length`
* `n == grid[i].length`
* `1 <= m, n <= 300`
* `grid[i][j]` is `'0'` or `'1'`.

## Solution

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int numIslands(vector<vector<char>>& grid) {
        int count = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < grid.size(); ++i) {
            for (int j = 0; j < grid[0].size(); ++j) {
                if (grid[i][j] == '0') continue; 
                ++count;
                expand(grid, j, i);
            }
        }
        return count;
    }
    void expand(vector<vector<char>>& grid, int x, int y) {
        if (x < 0 || x >= grid[0].size()) return;
        if (y < 0 || y >= grid.size()) return;
        if (grid[y][x] == '1') {
            grid[y][x] = '0';
            expand(grid, x - 1, y);
            expand(grid, x, y + 1);
            expand(grid, x + 1, y);
            expand(grid, x, y - 1);
        }
    }
};
```
