# 121. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock

## Problem

Say you have an array for which the _i_th element is the price of a given stock on day _i_.

If you were only permitted to complete at most one transaction \(i.e., buy one and sell one share of the stock\), design an algorithm to find the maximum profit.

Note that you cannot sell a stock before you buy one.

**Example 1:**

```text
Input: [7,1,5,3,6,4]
Output: 5
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.
             Not 7-1 = 6, as selling price needs to be larger than buying price.
```

**Example 2:**

```text
Input: [7,6,4,3,1]
Output: 0
Explanation: In this case, no transaction is done, i.e. max profit = 0.
```

## Solution

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maxProfit(vector<int>& prices) {
        if (prices.empty()) return 0;
        int buy = INT_MIN, sell = 0;
        for (const auto &p: prices) {
            buy = max(buy, -p);
            sell = max(buy + p, sell);
        }
        return sell;
    }
};
```
