# 123. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock III

## Problem

Say you have an array for which the _i_th element is the price of a given stock on day _i_.

Design an algorithm to find the maximum profit. You may complete at most _two_ transactions.

**Note:** You may not engage in multiple transactions at the same time \(i.e., you must sell the stock before you buy again\).

**Example 1:**

```text
Input: prices = [3,3,5,0,0,3,1,4]
Output: 6
Explanation: Buy on day 4 (price = 0) and sell on day 6 (price = 3), profit = 3-0 = 3.
Then buy on day 7 (price = 1) and sell on day 8 (price = 4), profit = 4-1 = 3.
```

**Example 2:**

```text
Input: prices = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: 4
Explanation: Buy on day 1 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.
Note that you cannot buy on day 1, buy on day 2 and sell them later, as you are engaging multiple transactions at the same time. You must sell before buying again.
```

**Example 3:**

```text
Input: prices = [7,6,4,3,1]
Output: 0
Explanation: In this case, no transaction is done, i.e. max profit = 0.
```

**Example 4:**

```text
Input: prices = [1]
Output: 0
```

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= prices.length <= 105`
* `0 <= prices[i] <= 105`

## Solution

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maxProfit(vector<int>& prices) {
        if (prices.size() == 0) return 0;
        int firstbuy = INT_MIN, firstsell = 0, secondbuy = INT_MIN, secondsell = 0;
        for (const auto p: prices) {
            firstbuy = max(firstbuy, -p);
            firstsell = max(firstsell, firstbuy + p);
            secondbuy = max(secondbuy, firstsell - p);
            secondsell = max(secondsell, secondbuy + p);
        }
        return secondsell;
    }
};
```
