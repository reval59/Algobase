# 11. Container With Most Water

## Problem

Given `n` non-negative integers `a1, a2, ..., an` , where each represents a point at coordinate `(i, ai)`. `n` vertical lines are drawn such that the two endpoints of the line `i` is at `(i, ai)` and `(i, 0)`. Find two lines, which, together with the x-axis forms a container, such that the container contains the most water.

**Notice** that you may not slant the container.

**Example 1:** ![](../.gitbook/assets/question_11.jpg)

```text
Input: height = [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]
Output: 49
Explanation: The above vertical lines are represented by array [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]. In this case, the max area of water (blue section) the container can contain is 49.
```

**Example 2:**

```text
Input: height = [1,1]
Output: 1
```

**Example 3:**

```text
Input: height = [4,3,2,1,4]
Output: 16
```

**Example 4:**

```text
Input: height = [1,2,1]
Output: 2
```

**Constraints:**

* `2 <= height.length <= 3 * 104`
* `0 <= height[i] <= 3 * 104`

## Solution

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maxArea(vector<int>& height) {
        int begin = 0, end = height.size() - 1;
        int max_area = INT_MIN;
        while (begin < end) {
            max_area = max(min(height[begin], height[end]) * (end - begin), max_area);
            if (height[begin] < height[end]) ++begin;
            else --end;
        }
        return max_area;
    }
};
```
