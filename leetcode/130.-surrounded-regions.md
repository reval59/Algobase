# 130. Surrounded Regions

## Problem

Given a 2D board containing `'X'` and `'O'` \(**the letter O**\), capture all regions surrounded by `'X'`.

A region is captured by flipping all `'O'`s into `'X'`s in that surrounded region.

**Example:**

```text
X X X X
X O O X
X X O X
X O X X
```

After running your function, the board should be:

```text
X X X X
X X X X
X X X X
X O X X
```

**Explanation:**

Surrounded regions shouldnâ€™t be on the border, which means that any `'O'` on the border of the board are not flipped to `'X'`. Any `'O'` that is not on the border and it is not connected to an `'O'` on the border will be flipped to `'X'`. Two cells are connected if they are adjacent cells connected horizontally or vertically.

## Solution

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    void solve(vector<vector<char>>& board) {
        if (board.size() < 3 || board[0].size() < 3) return;
        const int w = board[0].size();
        const int h = board.size();
        for (int i = 0; i < w; ++i) {
            flip(board, 0, i);
            flip(board, h - 1, i);
        }
        
        for (int i = 1; i < h - 1; ++i) {
            flip(board, i, 0);
            flip(board, i, w - 1);
        }
        
        for (int i = 0; i < h; ++i) {
            for (int j = 0; j < w; ++j) {
                if (board[i][j] == 'N') board[i][j] = 'O';
                else if (board[i][j] == 'O') board[i][j] = 'X';
            }
        }
    }
    void flip(vector<vector<char>>& board, int row, int col) {
        const int w = board[0].size();
        const int h = board.size();
        if (row < 0 || row >= h || col < 0 || col >= w) return;
        if (board[row][col] == 'X' || board[row][col] == 'N') return;
        board[row][col] = 'N';
        flip(board, row + 1, col);
        flip(board, row - 1, col);
        flip(board, row, col + 1);
        flip(board, row, col - 1);
    }
};
```
