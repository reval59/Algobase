# 1143. Longest Common Subsequence

## Problem

Given two strings `text1` and `text2`, return the length of their longest common subsequence.

A _subsequence_ of a string is a new string generated from the original string with some characters\(can be none\) deleted without changing the relative order of the remaining characters. \(eg, "ace" is a subsequence of "abcde" while "aec" is not\). A _common subsequence_ of two strings is a subsequence that is common to both strings.

If there is no common subsequence, return 0.

**Example 1:**

```text
Input: text1 = "abcde", text2 = "ace" 
Output: 3  
Explanation: The longest common subsequence is "ace" and its length is 3.
```

**Example 2:**

```text
Input: text1 = "abc", text2 = "abc"
Output: 3
Explanation: The longest common subsequence is "abc" and its length is 3.
```

**Example 3:**

```text
Input: text1 = "abc", text2 = "def"
Output: 0
Explanation: There is no such common subsequence, so the result is 0.
```

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= text1.length <= 1000`
* `1 <= text2.length <= 1000`
* The input strings consist of lowercase English characters only.

## Solution

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int longestCommonSubsequence(string text1, string text2) {
        if (text1.empty() || text2.empty()) return 0;
        vector<vector<int>> dp(text1.size() + 1, vector<int>(text2.size() + 1));
        for (int i = 1; i <= text1.size(); ++i) {
            for (int j = 1; j <= text2.size(); ++j) {
                if (text1[i - 1] == text2[j - 1]) dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j - 1] + 1;
                else dp[i][j] = max(dp[i - 1][j], dp[i][j - 1]);
            }
        }
        return dp.back().back();   
    }
};
```
