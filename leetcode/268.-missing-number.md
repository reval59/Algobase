# 268. Missing Number

## 1. Problem

Given an array containing n distinct numbers taken from `0, 1, 2, ..., n`, find the one that is missing from the array.

**Example 1:**

```text
Input: [3,0,1]
Output: 2
```

**Example 2:**

```text
Input: [9,6,4,2,3,5,7,0,1]
Output: 8
```

**Note**:  
 Your algorithm should run in linear runtime complexity. Could you implement it using only constant extra space complexity?

## Solution

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int missingNumber(vector<int>& nums) {
        int sum = (1 + nums.size()) * nums.size() / 2;
        for (const auto &n: nums) sum -= n;
        return sum;
    }
};
```
