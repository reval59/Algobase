# 141. Linked List Cycle

## Problem

Given `head`, the head of a linked list, determine if the linked list has a cycle in it.

There is a cycle in a linked list if there is some node in the list that can be reached again by continuously following the `next` pointer. Internally, `pos` is used to denote the index of the node that tail's `next` pointer is connected to. **Note that `pos` is not passed as a parameter**.

Return `true` _if there is a cycle in the linked list_. Otherwise, return `false`.

**Follow up:**

Can you solve it using `O(1)` \(i.e. constant\) memory?

**Example 1:** ![](../.gitbook/assets/circularlinkedlist.png)

```text
Input: head = [3,2,0,-4], pos = 1
Output: true
Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where the tail connects to the 1st node (0-indexed).
```

**Example 2:** ![](../.gitbook/assets/circularlinkedlist_test2.png)

```text
Input: head = [1,2], pos = 0
Output: true
Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where the tail connects to the 0th node.
```

**Example 3:** ![](../.gitbook/assets/circularlinkedlist_test3.png)

```text
Input: head = [1], pos = -1
Output: false
Explanation: There is no cycle in the linked list.
```

**Constraints:**

* The number of the nodes in the list is in the range `[0, 104]`.
* `-105 <= Node.val <= 105`
* `pos` is `-1` or a **valid index** in the linked-list.

## Solution

```cpp
/**
 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * struct ListNode {
 *     int val;
 *     ListNode *next;
 *     ListNode(int x) : val(x), next(NULL) {}
 * };
 */
class Solution {
public:
    bool hasCycle(ListNode *head) {
        ListNode *slow = head, *fast = head;
        while (fast != nullptr) {
            fast = fast->next;
            if (fast) fast = fast->next;
            else return false;
            slow = slow->next;
            if (slow == fast) return true;
        }
        return false;
    }
};
```
