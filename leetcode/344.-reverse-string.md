# 344. Reverse String

## Problem

Write a function that reverses a string. The input string is given as an array of characters `char[]`.

Do not allocate extra space for another array, you must do this by **modifying the input array** [**in-place**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-place_algorithm) with O\(1\) extra memory.

You may assume all the characters consist of [printable ascii characters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII#Printable_characters).

**Example 1:**

```text
Input: ["h","e","l","l","o"]
Output: ["o","l","l","e","h"]
```

**Example 2:**

```text
Input: ["H","a","n","n","a","h"]
Output: ["h","a","n","n","a","H"]
```

## Solution

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    void reverseString(vector<char>& s) {
        for (int i = 0; i < s.size() / 2; i++) {
            char temp = s[i];
            s[i] = s[s.size() - i - 1];
            s[s.size() - i - 1] = temp;
        }
    }
};
```
