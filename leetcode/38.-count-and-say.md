# 38. Count and Say

## Problem

The count-and-say sequence is the sequence of integers with the first five terms as following:

```text
1.     1
2.     11
3.     21
4.     1211
5.     111221
```

`1` is read off as `"one 1"` or `11`.  
 `11` is read off as `"two 1s"` or `21`.  
 `21` is read off as `"one 2`, then `one 1"` or `1211`.

Given an integer n where 1 ≤ _n_ ≤ 30, generate the nth term of the count-and-say sequence. You can do so recursively, in other words from the previous member read off the digits, counting the number of digits in groups of the same digit.

Note: Each term of the sequence of integers will be represented as a string.

**Example 1:**

```text
Input: 1
Output: "1"
Explanation: This is the base case.
```

**Example 2:**

```text
Input: 4
Output: "1211"
Explanation: For n = 3 the term was "21" in which we have two groups "2" and "1", "2" can be read as "12" which means frequency = 1 and value = 2, the same way "1" is read as "11", so the answer is the concatenation of "12" and "11" which is "1211".
```

## Solution

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    string countAndSay(int n) {
        string str;
        countAndSay(n, str);
        return str;
    }
    inline void countAndSay(int n, string &str) {
        if (n == 1) {
            str = "1"; return;
        }
        countAndSay(n - 1, str);
        int count = 0;
        string newstr;
        for (int i = 0; i < str.size(); ++i) {
            ++count;
            if (i == str.size() - 1 || str[i] != str[i + 1]) {
                newstr += to_string(count) + str[i];
                count = 0;
            }
        }
        str = newstr;
    }
};
```
