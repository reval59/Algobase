# 338. Counting Bits

## Problem

Given a non-negative integer number **num**. For every number **i** in the range **0 ≤ i ≤ num** calculate the number of 1's in their binary representation and return them as an array.

**Example 1:**

```text
Input: 2
Output: [0,1,1]
```

**Example 2:**

```text
Input: 5
Output: [0,1,1,2,1,2]
```

**Follow up:**

* It is very easy to come up with a solution with run time **O\(n\*sizeof\(integer\)\)**. But can you do it in linear time **O\(n\)** /possibly in a single pass?
* Space complexity should be **O\(n\)**.
* Can you do it like a boss? Do it without using any builtin function like **\_\_builtin\_popcount** in c++ or in any other language.

## Solution

### 1. $$O(N \times sizeof(integer))$$ 

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> countBits(const int num) {
        vector<int> counter;
        counter.reserve(num + 1);
        counter.push_back(0);
        for (int i = 1; i <= num; ++i) {
            int powerof2 = 1;
            while ((powerof2 << 1) <= i) powerof2 <<= 1;
            counter.push_back(counter[i - powerof2] + 1);
        }
        return counter;
    }
};
```

### 2. $$O(N)$$ 

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> countBits(const int num) {
        vector<int> counter;
        counter.reserve(num + 1);
        counter.push_back(0);
        int powerof2 = 1;
        for (int i = 1; i <= num; ++i) {
            if ((powerof2 << 1) <= i) powerof2 <<= 1;
            counter.push_back(counter[i - powerof2] + 1);
        }
        return counter;
    }
};
```

* \#bitwise
