# 337. House Robber III

## Problem

The thief has found himself a new place for his thievery again. There is only one entrance to this area, called the "root." Besides the root, each house has one and only one parent house. After a tour, the smart thief realized that "all houses in this place forms a binary tree". It will automatically contact the police if two directly-linked houses were broken into on the same night.

Determine the maximum amount of money the thief can rob tonight without alerting the police.

**Example 1:**

```text
Input: [3,2,3,null,3,null,1]

     3
    / \
   2   3
    \   \ 
     3   1

Output: 7 
Explanation: Maximum amount of money the thief can rob = 3 + 3 + 1 = 7.
```

**Example 2:**

```text
Input: [3,4,5,1,3,null,1]

     3
    / \
   4   5
  / \   \ 
 1   3   1

Output: 9
Explanation: Maximum amount of money the thief can rob = 4 + 5 = 9.
```

## Solution

```cpp
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * struct TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode *left;
 *     TreeNode *right;
 *     TreeNode() : val(0), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
 *     TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
 *     TreeNode(int x, TreeNode *left, TreeNode *right) : val(x), left(left), right(right) {}
 * };
 */
struct Node {
    int in;
    int ex;
    Node(int in, int ex) : in(in), ex(ex) {}
};
class Solution {
public:
    int rob(TreeNode* root) {
        const auto &result = rob_(root);
        return max(result.in, result.ex);
    }
    Node rob_(TreeNode* root) {
        if (root == nullptr) return Node(0, 0);
        const Node &left = rob_(root->left);
        const Node &right = rob_(root->right);
        int in = root->val + left.ex + right.ex;
        int ex = max(left.in, left.ex) + max(right.in, right.ex);
        return Node(in, ex);
    }
};
```
