# 461. Hamming Distance

## Problem

The [Hamming distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamming_distance) between two integers is the number of positions at which the corresponding bits are different.

Given two integers `x` and `y`, calculate the Hamming distance.

**Note:**  
 0 ≤ `x`, `y` &lt; 231.

**Example:**

```text
Input: x = 1, y = 4

Output: 2

Explanation:
1   (0 0 0 1)
4   (0 1 0 0)
       ↑   ↑

The above arrows point to positions where the corresponding bits are different.
```

## Solution

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int hammingDistance(int x, int y) {
        int z = x ^ y;
        int count = 0;
        while (z > 0) {
            if ((z & 1) == 1) count++;
            z >>= 1;
        }
        return count;
    }
};
```
