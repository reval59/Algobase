# 787. Cheapest Flights Within K Stops

## Problem

There are `n` cities connected by `m` flights. Each flight starts from city `u` and arrives at `v` with a price `w`.

Now given all the cities and flights, together with starting city `src` and the destination `dst`, your task is to find the cheapest price from `src` to `dst` with up to `k` stops. If there is no such route, output `-1`.

### Example Graph

![](../.gitbook/assets/995.png)

```text
Example 1:
Input: 
n = 3, edges = [[0,1,100],[1,2,100],[0,2,500]]
src = 0, dst = 2, k = 1
Output: 200
Explanation: 
The cheapest price from city 0 to city 2 with at most 1 stop costs 200, as marked red in the picture.
```

```text
Example 2:
Input: 
n = 3, edges = [[0,1,100],[1,2,100],[0,2,500]]
src = 0, dst = 2, k = 0
Output: 500
Explanation: 
The cheapest price from city 0 to city 2 with at most 0 stop costs 500, as marked blue in the picture.
```

**Constraints:**

* The number of nodes `n` will be in range `[1, 100]`, with nodes labeled from `0` to `n` `- 1`.
* The size of `flights` will be in range `[0, n * (n - 1) / 2]`.
* The format of each flight will be `(src,` `dst, price)`.
* The price of each flight will be in the range `[1, 10000]`.
* `k` is in the range of `[0, n - 1]`.
* There will not be any duplicated flights or self cycles.

## Solution

### 1. Bellman-Ford

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int findCheapestPrice(const int n, vector<vector<int>>& flights, int src, int dst, int K) {
        vector<int> distance(n, INT_MAX);
        distance[src] = 0;
        vector<int> next_distance(distance);
        for (int i = 0; i <= K; ++i) {
            for (const auto &edge: flights) {
                const int u = edge[0], v = edge[1], w = edge[2];
                if (distance[u] == INT_MAX) continue;
                if (distance[u] + w < next_distance[v]) {
                    next_distance[v] = distance[u] + w;
                }
            }
            for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) distance[i] = next_distance[i];
        }
        return distance[dst] == INT_MAX ? -1: distance[dst];
    }
};

```

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int findCheapestPrice(const int n, vector<vector<int>>& flights, int src, int dst, int K) {
        vector<int> distance(n, INT_MAX);
        distance[src] = 0;
        vector<int> next_distance(distance);
        
        vector<vector<pair<int, int>>> graph(n, vector<pair<int,int>>());
        for (const auto &edge: flights) {
            const int u = edge[0], v = edge[1], w = edge[2];
            graph[u].push_back({v, w});
        }
        
        stack<int> current, next;
        current.push(src);
        for (int i = 0; i <= K; ++i) {
            while (!current.empty()) {
                const int u = current.top(); current.pop();
                for (const auto &pair: graph[u]) {
                    const int v = pair.first, w = pair.second;
                    if (distance[u] + w < next_distance[v]) {
                        next_distance[v] = distance[u] + w;
                        next.push(v);
                    }
                }
            }
            current.swap(next);
            for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) distance[i] = next_distance[i];
        }
        return distance[dst] == INT_MAX ? -1: distance[dst];
    }
};
