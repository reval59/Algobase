# 387. First Unique Character in a String

## Problem

Given a string, find the first non-repeating character in it and return its index. If it doesn't exist, return -1.

**Examples:**

```text
s = "leetcode"
return 0.

s = "loveleetcode"
return 2.
```

**Note:** You may assume the string contains only lowercase English letters.

## Solution

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int firstUniqChar(string s) {
        int counter[26] = {0};
        for (const auto &c: s) counter[c - 'a']++;
        for (int i = 0; i < s.size(); i++) {
            if (counter[s[i] - 'a'] == 1) return i;
        }
        return -1;
    }
};
```
