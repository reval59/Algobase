# 310. Minimum Height Trees



A tree is an undirected graph in which any two vertices are connected by exactly one path. In other words, any connected graph without simple cycles is a tree.

Given a tree of `n` nodes labelled from `0` to `n - 1`, and an array of `n - 1` `edges` where `edges[i] = [ai, bi]` indicates that there is an undirected edge between the two nodes `ai` and `bi` in the tree, you can choose any node of the tree as the root. When you select a node `x` as the root, the result tree has height `h`. Among all possible rooted trees, those with minimum height \(i.e. `min(h)`\)  are called **minimum height trees** \(MHTs\).

Return _a list of all **MHTs'** root labels_. You can return the answer in **any order**.

The **height** of a rooted tree is the number of edges on the longest downward path between the root and a leaf.

**Example 1:** ![](../.gitbook/assets/e1.jpg)

```text
Input: n = 4, edges = [[1,0],[1,2],[1,3]]
Output: [1]
Explanation: As shown, the height of the tree is 1 when the root is the node with label 1 which is the only MHT.
```

**Example 2:** ![](../.gitbook/assets/e2.jpg)

```text
Input: n = 6, edges = [[3,0],[3,1],[3,2],[3,4],[5,4]]
Output: [3,4]
```

**Example 3:**

```text
Input: n = 1, edges = []
Output: [0]
```

**Example 4:**

```text
Input: n = 2, edges = [[0,1]]
Output: [0,1]
```

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= n <= 2 * 104`
* `edges.length == n - 1`
* `0 <= ai, bi < n`
* `ai != bi`
* All the pairs `(ai, bi)` are distinct.
* The given input is **guaranteed** to be a tree and there will be **no repeated** edges.

## Solution

### 1. Naive DFS \(Timeout\) 

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> findMinHeightTrees(const int n, vector<vector<int>>& edges) {
        vector<vector<int>> adj(n, vector<int>());
        for (const auto &edge: edges) {
            adj[edge[0]].push_back(edge[1]);
            adj[edge[1]].push_back(edge[0]);
        }
        bool visited[n];
        vector<int> depth(n);
        int min_depth = INT_MAX;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            memset(visited, 0, n);
            depth[i] = getMaxDepth(i, adj, visited);
            if (depth[i] < min_depth) min_depth = depth[i];
        }
        vector<int> nodes;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            if (depth[i] == min_depth) nodes.push_back(i);
        }
        return nodes;
    }
    int getMaxDepth(int src, vector<vector<int>> &adj, bool *visited) {
        visited[src] = true;
        int max_depth = 0;
        for (const auto e: adj[src]) {
            if (visited[e]) continue;
            visited[e] = true;
            int d = getMaxDepth(e, adj, visited) + 1;
            if (d > max_depth) max_depth = d;
        }
        return max_depth;
    }
};
```
