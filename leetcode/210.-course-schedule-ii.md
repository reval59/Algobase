# 210. Course Schedule II

## Problem

There are a total of `n` courses you have to take labelled from `0` to `n - 1`.

Some courses may have `prerequisites`, for example, if `prerequisites[i] = [ai, bi]` this means you must take the course `bi` before the course `ai`.

Given the total number of courses `numCourses` and a list of the `prerequisite` pairs, return the ordering of courses you should take to finish all courses.

If there are many valid answers, return **any** of them. If it is impossible to finish all courses, return **an empty array**.

**Example 1:**

```text
Input: numCourses = 2, prerequisites = [[1,0]]
Output: [0,1]
Explanation: There are a total of 2 courses to take. To take course 1 you should have finished course 0. So the correct course order is [0,1].
```

**Example 2:**

```text
Input: numCourses = 4, prerequisites = [[1,0],[2,0],[3,1],[3,2]]
Output: [0,2,1,3]
Explanation: There are a total of 4 courses to take. To take course 3 you should have finished both courses 1 and 2. Both courses 1 and 2 should be taken after you finished course 0.
So one correct course order is [0,1,2,3]. Another correct ordering is [0,2,1,3].
```

**Example 3:**

```text
Input: numCourses = 1, prerequisites = []
Output: [0]
```

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= numCourses <= 2000`
* `0 <= prerequisites.length <= numCourses * (numCourses - 1)`
* `prerequisites[i].length == 2`
* `0 <= ai, bi < numCourses`
* `ai != bi`
* All the pairs `[ai, bi]` are **distinct**.

## Solution

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool wordBreak(string &s, vector<string>& wordDict) {
        const int n = s.size() + 1;
        bool dp[n];
        memset(dp, false, sizeof(bool) * n);
        dp[0] = true;
        for (int i = 1; i < n; ++i) {
            for (const auto &str: wordDict) {
                const int len = str.size();
                if (i - len < 0) continue;
                bool match = true;
                for (int j = len - 1, k = 1; j >= 0; --j, ++k) {
                    if (str[j] != s[i - k]) {
                        match = false; break;
                    }
                }
                dp[i] = match && dp[i - len];
                if (dp[i]) break;
            }
        }
        return dp[n - 1];
    }
};
```
