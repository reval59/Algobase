# 39. Combination Sum

## Problem

Given a **set** of candidate numbers \(`candidates`\) **\(without duplicates\)** and a target number \(`target`\), find all unique combinations in `candidates` where the candidate numbers sums to `target`.

The **same** repeated number may be chosen from `candidates` unlimited number of times.

**Note:**

* All numbers \(including `target`\) will be positive integers.
* The solution set must not contain duplicate combinations.

**Example 1:**

```text
Input: candidates = [2,3,6,7], target = 7,
A solution set is:
[
  [7],
  [2,2,3]
]
```

**Example 2:**

```text
Input: candidates = [2,3,5], target = 8,
A solution set is:
[
  [2,2,2,2],
  [2,3,3],
  [3,5]
]
```

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= candidates.length <= 30`
* `1 <= candidates[i] <= 200`
* Each element of `candidate` is unique.
* `1 <= target <= 500`

## Solution

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<vector<int>> combinationSum(vector<int>& cand, int target) {
        vector<vector<int>> combs;
        vector<int> comb;
        combinationSum(combs, comb, cand, 0, target);
        return combs;
    }
    void combinationSum(vector<vector<int>> &combs, vector<int> &comb, vector<int>& cand, int begin, int target) {
        if (target < 0) return;
        if (target == 0) combs.push_back(comb);
        for (int i = begin; i < cand.size(); ++i) {
            comb.push_back(cand[i]);
            combinationSum(combs, comb, cand, i, target - cand[i]);
            comb.pop_back();
        }
    }
};
```
